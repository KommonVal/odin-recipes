      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 eggs beaten</li>
          <li>1 cup panko</li>  
          <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>  
          <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>  
          <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>  
          <li>Frying oil of choice</li>  
          <li>1 small onion sliced</li>  
          <li>2 carrots cubed</li>  
          <li>2 medium potatoes cubed</li>  
          <li>3 cups water</li>  
          <li>1 pack 3.2 ounces Japanese curry mix</li>  
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>For the tonkatsu: Heat oil in a large pan over medium high heat. While oil is heating up start dredging the pork.</li>
           <li>Place the eggs, panko, and flour in three separate shallow dishes.</li>  
           <li>Add garlic salt and pepper to the flour and mix to combine.</li> 
           <li>Next coat the pork in flour. Be sure to shake off any excess flour. Then dip in the eggs being sure to cover the entire surface of the pork. And lastly dip in the panko. You can press the panko on to the pork to ensure even coverage.</li>  
           <li>Once the oil has reached about 350F, place the pork in the pan and fry until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side. Cook to an internal temperature of 145F.</li>  
           <li>Remove pork and place on a paper towel or a cooling rack set over a cookie sheet to catch excess oil.</li> 
           <li>For the curry: Add 1 tablespoon oil to a pot. Add onion and saute until translucent. Then add carrots and potatoes and continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes. Lastly, add water and bring to a boil.</li>
           <li>Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li> 
           <li>Add curry mix and stir until combined. Continue to simmer for another 10 minutes or until vegetables are to your desired tenderness. Set aside. Slice pork in 1/2 inch strips. Serve with rice and curry.</li> 
        </ol>
